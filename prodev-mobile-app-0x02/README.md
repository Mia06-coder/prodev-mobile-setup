## Overview

This task focuses on implementing **Safe Areas, Images, and Touchable Components** in a React Native Expo application.

The UI includes a full-screen background image, centered logo, styled text, and interactive buttons, all wrapped safely inside a `SafeAreaProvider` and `SafeAreaView`.

---

## Objectives

- Use `SafeAreaView` and `SafeAreaProvider` to prevent UI overlap with device notches.
- Add background images with `ImageBackground` and `Dimensions`.
- Display a centered company logo using `Image`.
- Style and arrange text groups.
- Add interactive buttons with `TouchableOpacity`.
- Provide a navigation prompt at the bottom of the screen.

## Steps Followed

   npx create-expo-app@latest prodev-mobile-app-0x02
   ```

2. **Reset Template**

   ```bash

   npm run reset-project
   ```

3. **Added Assets**

   - Moved `Logo.png` and `background-image.png` into:

     ```
     assets/images/
     ```

4. **Updated `app/index.tsx`**

   - Wrapped app in `SafeAreaProvider` and `SafeAreaView`.
   - Added background image covering full screen.
   - Inserted company logo at center.
   - Added styled text group.
