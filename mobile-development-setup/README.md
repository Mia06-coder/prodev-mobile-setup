# Mobile Development Environment Setup

This repository documents the setup process for my mobile development environment using the `Expo Framework` for `React Native`. The goal is to ensure I have all the essential tools ready for upcoming mobile projects.

## 📌 Objective

Mobile development often requires powerful hardware and emulators, but **Expo Go** provides a simpler way to run and test applications directly on physical devices. This setup ensures I can start building and testing React Native applications seamlessly.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To complete this setup, I ensured I had the following installed:

- Node.js LTS
- VS Code (recommended IDE)
- Compatible operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows)

## 📱 Expo Go Setup (iOS)

1. Installed Expo Go from the Apple App Store.
2. Opened the Expo Go app on my iPhone.
3. Signed up with email, username, and password.

✅ That’s it — Expo Go is ready for testing React Native apps on my physical device.

## 🚀 Why Expo Go?

- Eliminates the need for costly device emulators.
- Works seamlessly across both `iOS` and `Android`.
- Allows rapid testing of React Native apps directly on a physical device.
- Provides a streamlined developer experience with live reloading.

## ⚡ Challenges Faced

For my setup, the process was straightforward:

- No issues installing Expo Go.
- Successfully created an account on the first attempt.
