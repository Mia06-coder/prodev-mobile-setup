# prodev-mobile-setup

This repository documents my journey into **mobile application development** using **React Native** and the **Expo framework**.

---

## Why React Native + Expo?

- **React Native** enables building truly native mobile apps for **iOS** and **Android** using **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **React**.
- **Expo** provides powerful developer tooling, faster builds, and access to native APIs without extra configuration.
- **Expo Router** introduces a file-based routing system that makes navigation intuitive and scalable.

---

## Goals

- Learn the foundations of **React Native** and **Expo**.
- Explore project structures, setups, and routing strategies.
- Practice mobile-first design and clean code organization.
- Build toward production-ready apps.
